2. **Academic projects** demonstrate initiative and foundational skills.  
3. **Certifications** (Oracle Java) validate technical basics.  

**Gaps (Why Moderate Match?):**  
1. **Limited real-world Agile experience** (only theoretical Scrum knowledge).  
2. **No exposure to TCS-specific tools** (e.g., TCS BaNCS, Jira).
