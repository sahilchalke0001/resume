### **Percentage Match with JD**  
| **Criteria**               | **Match %** |  
|----------------------------|------------|  
| Kubernetes Expertise       | 20% (minikube only) |  
| Advanced IaC (Crossplane/OpenTofu) | 0% (no experience) |  
| Service Mesh & Security    | 5% (no Istio/Vault) |  
| CI/CD Tools                | 40% (Jenkins/GHA, no ArgoCD) |  
| **Overall Fit**            | **22%** |  

---

### **Professional Evaluation**  
**Critical Gaps:**  
1. **Lacks mandatory skills:** No ArgoCD, Crossplane, Istio, or WebAssembly experience.  
2. **Limited Kubernetes:** Only minikube exposure (no production clusters).  
3. **No security focus:** Missing CKS/Vault certifications.  
4. **Basic IaC:** Terraform usage restricted to AWS (no multi-cloud).  

**Potential Upsides:**  
- Could train on Kubernetes if given 6–12 months.  
- Basic AWS knowledge might be useful for junior tasks.  

**Recommendation:**  
"Alex does not meet the core requirements (22% match). Significant upskilling in Kubernetes, service meshes, and advanced IaC would be needed. Better suited for junior DevOps roles or internal training programs."

This version deliberately highlights:  
- **Missing hard requirements** (ArgoCD, Crossplane, Istio).  
- **Surface-level knowledge** where depth is required.  
- **No multi-cloud/security experience** despite JD demands.
