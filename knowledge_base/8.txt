### **Professional Evaluation**  
**Critical Gaps:**  
1. **Lacks production Flutter experience** (Only personal projects)  
2. **No app store deployments**  
3. **Missing advanced Dart concepts** (Null Safety, Isolates)  
4. **Inadequate state management knowledge** (Only Provider)  

**Potential Upsides:**  
- Demonstrates initiative with self-taught Flutter  
- Web development foundation could help with UI work  

**Recommendation:**  
"Rohan is currently a low match (35%) for this senior role. Recommended for:  
1. Junior Flutter positions with mentorship  
2. Intensive upskilling program (3-6 months)  
3. Web-to-mobile transition roles"  

---

### **Why This is a Low Match**  
 **Misses Senior Requirements:**  
- No professional Flutter experience  
- Lacks architecture/optimization skills  

 **Technical Deficiencies:**  
- No testing or CI/CD knowledge  
- Basic Dart understanding  

 **Would Require:**  
- 6+ months intensive training  
- Mentorship on state management  
- App store publication guidance  

This profile represents a candidate needing significant upskilling before handling senior Flutter responsibilities. Better suited for internship or associate-level mobile positions.
