| **JD Requirement**               | **Candidate Qualification**       | **Match %** |  
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|  
| **Core Java (Low-Latency Focus)**| Basic Java, no JVM tuning        | **20%**     |  
| **Distributed Systems**          | No Kafka/gRPC/Aeron experience   | **0%**      |  
| **Financial Domain Knowledge**   | No trading systems exposure      | **0%**      |

### **Professional Evaluation**  
**Critical Gaps:**  
1. **No low-latency Java experience** (Goldman requires **microsecond optimizations**)  
2. **Zero financial trading systems knowledge** (Never worked with **FIX protocol, market data**)  
3. **Basic multithreading** (No **lock-free algorithms, disruptor pattern**)  
4. **No exposure to distributed messaging (Kafka, Aeron)**  

**Potential Upsides:**  
- Strong in **Spring Boot** (useful for internal tools, not trading systems)  
- Could transition to **non-latency-sensitive backend roles**  

**Recommendation:**  
"Rahul is a **low match (30%)** for this **high-frequency trading (HFT) role**. He lacks **critical financial systems and low-latency Java expertise**. Better fits:  
1. **Retail banking IT roles**  
2. **Enterprise Java backend teams (non-trading)**  
3. **Upskilling program in distributed systems** before reapplying."  

---

### **Why This is a Low Match**  
 **Misses Core Trading Tech Stack:**  
- No **Aeron/Chronicle Queue** (used in HFT)  
- Never worked with **FIX protocol** (critical for trading systems)  

 **Inadequate Performance Skills:**  
- Goldman requires **nanosecond-level latency tuning**  
- Candidate only knows **basic Java threading**  

 **Would Need:**  
- **1+ years of intensive training** in financial systems  
- **Hands-on work** with **market data feeds**  
- **Deep JVM/OS-level optimizations**  

This profile represents a **typical enterprise Java developer** who would struggle in **Goldman’s ultra-low-latency environment**. Better suited for **retail banking IT** than **securities trading engineering**.
