### **Evaluation**  
**Why This Fails:**  
1. **Zero aviation experience** (Metro job irrelevant)  
2. **Language barrier** (Airlines require fluent English + bonus language)  
3. **Commitment issues** (Relocation is mandatory)  

**Alternative Suggestions:**  
1. Apply for **ground staff** roles first  
2. Complete **aviation courses** (safety/first aid)  
3. Improve **English proficiency** (IELTS 6.5+)
