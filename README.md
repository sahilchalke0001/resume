# ATS Resume Tracker

## Overview

The **ATS Resume Tracker** is a full-stack web application that provides a comprehensive, AI-powered analysis of resumes against specific job descriptions (JDs). It utilizes **Google Gemini API** for contextual understanding, **LangChain** for orchestration, and **MongoDB** with vector search to implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This ensures deep semantic matching between resumes and job descriptions.

The system offers a professional evaluation of uploaded PDF resumes, computes a **percentage match**, generates a **strengths and weaknesses analysis**, and enhances accessibility with **audio playback** and **YouTube video generation**. The results can be **viewed on the site**, **emailed to the user**, or **downloaded as a PDF report**.

## Project Features

- **Resume Upload and Parsing**: Accepts resumes in PDF format and extracts structured content such as skills, education, experience, etc.
- **Contextual JD Matching**: Uses **LangChain + Gemini API + MongoDB vector index** to retrieve and compare relevant information from the resume and job description.
- **Strengths and Weaknesses Evaluation**: AI-generated summary that highlights what a candidate excels in and areas needing improvement.
- **Percentage Match Score**: Reflects how closely the resume aligns with the job description based on AI-driven semantic similarity.
- **Audio Playback**: The result section includes a "Play Audio" button that reads the summary aloud using text-to-speech.
- **PDF Download**: The complete evaluation can be downloaded by the user as a professionally formatted PDF.
- **YouTube Integration**: Based on the evaluation, the app uses the **YouTube API** to recommend personalized videos (e.g., resume tips, upskilling tutorials) directly within the UI.
- **Email Notification**: The final result is emailed to the user for easy reference.
- **Modern Web Interface**: Built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure responsive and user-friendly design.
